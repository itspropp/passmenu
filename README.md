# passmenu
A passmenu fork which types the username and copies the password to the clipboard at the same time, so you only have to run it once. Saves a lot of time for me ^_^

Requires that the username/email is prefixed with 'login: ' in your password database.

## Usage: 

    passmenu --type-and-copy
